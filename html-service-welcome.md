Browsh is a modern, text-based browser. This HTML service can render everything that a modern browser can; JS, HTML5, SSL/TLS, WebGL and WebAssembly.

To use it you need only prefix normal URLs with 'html.brow.sh'. For example;

[html.brow.sh/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet)

This service is still very much in its early days, so you will likely find many pages with rendering issues. Please report specific URLs on [Browsh's GitHub repo](https://github.com/browsh-org/browsh/issues).

All rendered pages are cached by a global CDN for at least 5 minutes, so you'll need to wait to trigger a re-render. Also there is a rate limit of around 10 requests per minute per IP address.

If you'd like to see Browsh improve please consider [donating](https://www.brow.sh/donate/).
