## FAQs

**It's not fast or saving me bandwidth**    
Browsh's main usecase is to be run on a remote server, such as a cloud VM, where there is
fast and cheap bandwidth. You can then access Browsh's output over any normal SSH client
or better yet [Mosh](https://mosh.org/) (though note that self-compiling Mosh is currently needed to get true colour support). You can also access Browsh's output via a normal browser by running Browsh in HTTP mode: `browsh --http-server-mode`.

**It doesn't work on Windows**    
This is a known bug, it's not been a top priority because of the main usecase described
in the previous FAQ answer here. Please follow this [Github issue](https://github.com/browsh-org/browsh/issues/32) for updates.

**It works but the graphics has long black lines in it**    
Your terminal doesn't support true colour, see here for more details: [https://gist.github.com/XVilka/8346728](https://gist.github.com/XVilka/8346728)
