The following config will be copied to your filesystem, e.g.     
`${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/browsh/config.toml` on *'nix* systems. If you can't find it run Browsh
with `browsh --debug` and look in `./debug.log` for the actual location.

```toml
# See; https://www.brow.sh/donate/
# By showing your support you can disable the app's branding and nags to donate.
browsh_supporter = "â™¥"

# it will need to have been launched with the `--marionette` flag.

# Launch Firefox in with its visible GUI window. Useful for setting up the Browsh profile.

[tty]
# The time in milliseconds between requesting a new TTY-sized pixel frame.

# The dimensions of a char-based window onto a webpage.
# The columns are ultimately the width of the final text. Whereas the rows

  --http-server-mode       Run as an HTTP service
  --startup-url string     URL to launch at startup (default "https://google.com")
  --time-limit int         Kill Browsh after the specified number of seconds
```
