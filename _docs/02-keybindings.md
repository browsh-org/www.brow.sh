Browsh attempts, where ever possible, to retain the conventional keybindings
you would usually associate with a desktop browser. Even so, for clarity here
are all the keybindings.

## General

Note that OSX users need to use the `⌘/Command` key instead of `CTRL`.

`F1` Opens the documentation    
`ARROW KEYS`, `PGUP`, `PGDN` Scrolling    
`CTRL+q` Exit app    
`CTRL+l` Focus the URL bar   
`BACKSPACE` Go back in history    
`CTRL+r` Reload page    
`CTRL+t` New tab    
`CTRL+w` Close tab    
`CTRL+\` Cycle to next tab    

## Miscellaneous

`ALT+SHIFT+p` Takes a screenshot. The status bar will display the saved path    
`ALT+m` Toggles monochrome mode. Useful for overcoming rendering problems on older terminals.    
`ALT+u` Toggles the user agent between a desktop and a mobile device. Useful for smaller terminals that want to use a more suitable layout.
